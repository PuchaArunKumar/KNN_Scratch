# KNN_Scratch
KNN classification and clustering(regression) from Scratch
A complete implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm **from scratch** in Python for **classification, regression, and clustering** tasks.

This project does not rely on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` for the core algorithm â€“ instead, it implements KNN step-by-step to provide a clear understanding of how it works internally.
